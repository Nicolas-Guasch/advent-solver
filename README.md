# AdventSolver

My solutions to the popular yearly coding challenge known as [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/events).

In this repository you may find a collection of TypeScript implementations of my solutions alongside a web application dashboard in which to run them.

The code for each day can be found in src/solutions.

Currently, the solutions to the following challenges are present:

- 2023: Up to day 8.

In order to use the dashboard you must provide your own inputs, as no input files are included by default. Simply copy each day to public/input-files/ under the name day1.txt, day2.txt, day3.txt, etc.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.
